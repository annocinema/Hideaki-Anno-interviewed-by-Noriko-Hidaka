1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,810
In the near future, the world
stands on the brink of destruction.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,750
3 young pilots mature as
they operate gigantic machines

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,580
against the attacks of mysterious alien beings.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,010
Today we have director of the hit anime Neon
Genesis Evangelion, Anno Hideaki.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,980
Anno, you've hit it big.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,410
Me? Big?

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,910
What do you mean?

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,780
It doesn't feel like I've hit it big.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,710
Ok, so I watched Eva from start to
finish and thought it was amazing,

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,710
but all of these anime communities
are highlighting you like,

11
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,780
"Anno Hideaki, up and coming
with the younger generation."

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,680
It doesn't strike me that way.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,210
Really?

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,550
But, haven't people been
paying more attention to you?

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,150
Are people paying more attention?

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,110
Seriously, nothing like that sticks out to me.

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,180
When would you say you first started
developing an interest in movies?

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,050
When I was a kid I was more
into TV shows than movies.

19
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:53,980
I was raised on TV.

20
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,310
Was that mainly anime and tokusatsu?

21
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,310
Yeah, and other dramas like that.

22
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,950
Aside from that, I was raised normally.

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,350
I looked up to tokusatsu and the hero genre,

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,280
but I never thought about making it.

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,050
Making heroes?

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,410
Around high school, I started
getting into film. Like the 8mm.

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,310
Live filming?

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,610
Yeah, yeah. 8mm.

29
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,610
I worked on both anime and live film.

30
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,250
Out of the blue?

31
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,380
Out of the blue.

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,080
Was there someone who inspired you to start?

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,350
I wanted to try my hand at it.

34
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,750
I was hit with this sudden desire and went with it.

35
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,050
After messing around for a bit the quality
just started heading in its own direction.

36
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,080
I guess.

37
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,910
When you first started, did you practice
drawing movement with flip-books?

38
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
When you first started, did you practice
drawing movement with flip-books?

39
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:43,950
When you first started, did you practice
drawing movement with flip-books?

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,380
Before high school, I didn't have a textbook I could
work in, so I wasn't aware of what I could do.

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,910
I wanted to draw, but they have those annoying pictures

42
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,980
that show up along the edges where
you aren't supposed to write, right?

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,480
Right.

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,180
My high school textbooks didn't have those.

45
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,980
So it was easy to draw flip-book art.

46
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,650
Exactly.
So it was easy to draw flip-book art.

47
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,010
[Poor Gunner]
Early Works

48
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,050
Was Poor Gunner your first animated piece?

49
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,950
Actually, I did draw something
before that during high school,

50
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,280
but I have no idea where that went.

51
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,810
Poor Gunner, was made during your time off school?

52
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,350
Yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:25,150
During that time, hmmm what was
it? I felt I needed to hone my skills.

55
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,150
You were doing what you like.

56
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,910
It was training.

57
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,710
Training is boring.

58
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,310
Not all of it, but more likely than not, it's boring.

59
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,780
When I first watched Poor Gunner,

60
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,180
it felt so nostalgic like I'd seen
something similar to it before.

61
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,080
I mean, there was something like it.

62
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,650
What did you draw that on?

63
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,450
Daiei scratch paper.

64
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,880
Scratch paper, like for calculations?
Daiei, like the company?

65
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,480
Yeah. yeah.

66
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,780
On scratch paper?

67
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,310
Yep.

68
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,810
And you drew it page by page?

69
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,810
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,110
I didn't have the technical knowledge to
know about time sheets and stuff like that.

71
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,980
I just drew what felt right
and worked on it part-time.

72
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:21,780
I worked with a group where we would start
individually and then bring everything together.

73
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,580
I think... I think that was then that
your ANNO signature first appeared.

74
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,410
Yes, yes, yes.

75
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,080
That signature hasn't changed since then, has it?

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,150
It hasn't. It hasn't changed since middle school.

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,110
A-N-N

78
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,550
-O

79
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,810
-O
In art club, during middle school,
we naturally created our own art.

80
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,480
In art club, during middle school,
we naturally created our own art.

81
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,010
We wanted to distinguish ourselves
by adding signatures to the corner.

82
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,150
For oil paintings.

83
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,050
It's the same signature from back then.

84
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,780
[Tough Tire! SHADO Tire]
Freshman year of college

85
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,080
Um, wait, "Hataraku Kuruma" is the name of that
children's car song; what was your car animation?

86
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,980
Tough Tire?

87
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,410
Tough Tire! I was off by a long shot! Sorry!

88
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,550
Very long.

89
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,510
The car moved so precisely.

90
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,580
It bounced and drove around so well,

91
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:20,149
I thought "what are SHADO tires?"
and ended up watching again and again.

92
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:26,910
The motions were so fluid it felt like I
was watching an overseas cartoon.

93
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,850
Oh that's because I animated on ones,
so it was bound to come out fluid.

94
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,810
Does animating on ones tend to be more fluid?

95
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,080
Much more fluid.

96
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,810
Why?

97
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,850
Film has 24 frames per second.

98
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,050
Animating on ones means there is a
different drawing each of the 24 frame.

99
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,250
With most anime, out of the 24 frames,
only 8 frames are shown per second.

100
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,250
24 divided by 8 means it's animated on threes.

101
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,750
It's like that because of how you animated it?

102
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,810
Yeah, it appears to be moving about 3
times faster than standard TV anime.

103
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,710
Well, it sounds weird to
say it's moving 3 times faster.

104
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,580
Wasn't that a rather high-quality
animation for a college student's work?

105
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,610
It appears that way. I don't recall much about it.

106
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,480
Did it get any praise?

107
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,650
It was formally recognized.

108
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,480
Did you make it by yourself?

109
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
All by myself.

110
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,210
No way.

111
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,610
I think, wow, there was a time
Anno put out these kinds of shorts.

112
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,750
These kinds of shorts, huh.

113
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,780
Yeah, it took me by surprise.

114
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,750
Huh, from how I see it, it's nothing all
that unusual in the animation world.

115
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,210
Director Anno didn't just work on anime
but also worked with his fellow students

116
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,910
to create tokusatsu in pursuit of the
heroes he looked up to as a child.

117
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,450
One of those projects was Patriotic Squadron Great Japan.

118
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,450
Love!

119
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,280
Could we move away from
anime and into tokusatsu?

120
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,580
Yes.

121
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,050
You worked on Patriotic Squadron Great Japan.

122
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,280
It reminded me of Battle Fever J.

123
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,350
They're both sentai squads after all.

124
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,550
For that, for that you...

125
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,710
I assisted on set.

126
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,050
Assisted? As the what?
The mechanical designer?

127
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,850
As the designer, but also as the optical
effects person - the animation like effects.

128
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,550
I also wore the suits.

129
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,710
You did? Which color character?

130
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,180
Oh, no, I was in the robot or monster suits.

131
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,680
You did the narrations as well?

132
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,580
Yes, I narrated some parts.

133
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,280
Jinpu Takeshi trains around the
clock, ready for any emergency.

134
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,150
Their fight is only just beginning.

135
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,180
This was only the first step
toward protecting their country.

136
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,810
Your narration has a distinctive presence to it.

137
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,580
That, that was just me talking.

138
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,480
It was sufficient.

139
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,510
What material did you use for all the
transforming and combining robots?

140
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,080
Paper.

141
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,610
Paper?

142
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,280
Paper.

143
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,350
So you put the paper...wait, no,
how did you connect it all together?

144
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,410
Industrial strength glue.

145
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,310
It's paper crafting.
